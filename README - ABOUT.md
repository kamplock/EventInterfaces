# EventInterfaces
This project for CMP 311 Back End Design uses Interfaces and Unit Testing. There are 3 interfaces: a Wedding interface, a Birthday interface, and a Graduation interface. 
Each interface is implemented into the Events class. Notice how each interface has a printEventData() method, and an eventCode(char c) method. printEventData() prints the data about an event using the ID, event description, cost, and a blurb about the fake event scenerio (ie: "Weddings will only be held in XYZ Hall."). The eventCode() method takes in a char to determine if the event is eligible for some sort of discount or late fee, with 'd' or 'D' meaning a 10% discount, a 'l' or 'L' meaning a 10% late fee, an 'e' or 'E' for a 25% employee discount, and a 'f' or 'F' for a free event, while any other character returns the normal event cost. This is reflected in our unit tests, where we test out each char, plus an extra case for chars that are not 'L' or 'D,' which returns the original cost.
